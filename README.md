# kafka-demo-elasticsearch

##### This is a brief demo for how Kafka work with ElasticSearch.

The purpose of this demo, is to grab `twitter_tweets` data, send from Kafka to ElasticSearch via Kafka Consumer. `twitter_tweets` topic has been created and processed by previous demo [The Twitter Producer Demo](https://github.com/huaweichen/kafka-java-101/tree/master/src/main/java/kafkatwitter101)

* I have reset those hostname, username and password in this code, so feel free to replace yours in.
